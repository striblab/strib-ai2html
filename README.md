`ai2html` is an extremely helpful, open-source script for Adobe Illustrator that converts your Illustrator documents into html and css, specifically it exports a newsgraphic as an html page with html text that is layered over a background image. This is specifically helpful in making a graphic more responsive, performant, and SEO-friendly.

At the Star Tribune, the idea is that the produced file can be inserted into a Clickability article via an iframe via a strip-tag. It can fit inside the 525px standard middle column or you can hide the right column of the article and run it at 853px. It also has a version for mobile at 300px. Those are the 3 responsive sizes built into the template.
